# WebGISNetwork
web GIS network for avocado farmers

Developed using Geo Django for back-end and Leaflet JS for the front-end, enabling avocado farmers
in Nakuru County to locate suitable locations for growing avocadoes, track their avocado produce and 
contact stakeholders dealing in avocado to avoid dealing with brokers.
